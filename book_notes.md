## What is the Internet?
The Internet is a computer network that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices throughout the world. All of these devices are called *hosts* or *end systems*. <br />
End systems aare connected together by a network of *communication links* and *packet switches*. There are many types of communication links, which are made up of different types of physical media, including coaxial cable, copper wire, optical fiber and radio spectrum. Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the *transmission rate* of a link measured in bits/second. When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments the data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as *packets* in the jargon of computer networks, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data. <br />
End systems access the Internet through *Internet Service Providers (ISPs)*
